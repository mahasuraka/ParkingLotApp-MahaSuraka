# ParkingLotApp-MahaSuraka
A Java-based Parking Lot Management System that dynamically allocates parking slots based on vehicle size. Implements OOP-driven architecture with separate model, service, and CLI layers. Supports parking, exiting, and status reporting without requiring any database, using clean in-memory storage. Designed as part of a take-home coding challenge.
